This rules are defined to support the internal test suite.
They are copied from the example rules at some point, but may differ,
and are not intended to be used as an example rule implementation.

Changes in data class names should be synchronized with mock data
provided by the dsmask-mock package.

Changes in the set of rules should be synchronized with the expected
test output defined in dsmask-jconf.
